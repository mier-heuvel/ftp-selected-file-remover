The ultimate goal of this script is to log into an FTP server, 
scan for files in all folders and sub-folders, 
locate files set by certain criteria and remove said files.

The purpose for this is to remove files that were added to the server from a cloaked keywords and links hack.

Currently the script crashes my PC so don't run it yet.
